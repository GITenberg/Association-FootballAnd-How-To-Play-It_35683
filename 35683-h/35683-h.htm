</div></div>


<p>From the above quotation by Sir Walter Scott, it is
evident that football is quite an ancient game. Time
alters everything, and it has undoubtedly done so in
football. Where one used to play with half the village
on one side and the same on the other, it is now restricted
to sides composed of eleven players. As I have
been requested to write on the modern game it is not
worth while dwelling upon how it was played a hundred
years ago. Football is really supposed to be a Scottish
game, but it was in England that a proper Association
with defined rules was first started.</p>

<p>This was in the early sixties, and since then the F.A.
has grown to be one of the most powerful bodies connected
with sport of any shape or form. They are a
most wealthy association, and their power is paramount.
It must be said that they have had everything to do with
making the game what it is at present. Although autocratic,
they deal thoroughly and honestly with both clubs
and players, and it will be a bad day for the game when
any body of clubs break away. At the time of writing
rumours are very rife, but it is to be sincerely hoped that
once again "rumour is a lying jade." Friendly matches
were the order of the day in the early stages of the
game. Then came the establishment of the English
Cup Competition for all clubs in the Kingdom. This
was in the year 1871, and it was only after eleven years
had elapsed that the Cup went to the North, when
Blackburn Olympic were the winners. May we say
<i>en passant</i> that a Scottish club, namely, the Queen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Park of Glasgow, took part in the final contest in 1884
and 1885, but were beaten by the Blackburn Rovers in
both cases. After that the Cup had a long sojourn in
the North, and it was not until 1901 that my old club,
Tottenham Hotspur, managed to bring it back to
the South. Again, since then, the North have had a
monopoly of it, and Southern enthusiasts are longing
for it to have its resting-place somewhere in the South.</p>

<p>Another epoch in the game was the starting of the
League system of playing matches. The idea came
from the fertile brain of Mr. W. MacGregor, who is
familiarly known as the Father of the League. This
system undoubtedly proved a great success, and
although loyal amateurs still play in the same friendly
style the public took to it immensely, as is well shown
by the difference between the attendance at league and
friendly matches. Senior, junior, and school-boys'
are the names of the leagues now existing, not to mention
tradesmen's and shopkeepers' Thursday afternoon
associations. The mere fact that at Cup-ties and International
matches the attendance has been over 100,000
is convincing testimony to the winter pastime's popularity.
A record crowd assembled at Hampden Park,
Glasgow, last April to see England v. Scotland, the
attendance reaching 130,000, and the sight was a most
magnificent one. Before the close of my preface I
should like to express my regret at the separation of a
portion of the Amateur Element from the Parent Body
last year, and, personally, I could see no reason for their
so doing&mdash;I can only say, "The pity of it." Again,
football and charity are synonymous, and it would surprise
many critics if the total amount of money collected
by clubs and associations was reckoned up. The last
match in aid of charity was played at Stamford Bridge,
between Manchester United and Queen's Park Rangers,
and realised over £1,000, and I think that speaks for
itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

Goalkeepers and Goalkeeping.</h2>


<p>Goalkeepers, like poets, are born, not made. It
is really the most difficult position on the field to
occupy. If the half-back makes a mistake it can
be rectified by the man behind him, but if the goalkeeper
makes a blunder it is fatal. It is the one
position on the field that I have never occupied,
and I never had any desire to figure there. My
ideal for that position would be a man who stood
six feet and weighed at least thirteen stone, with
an eye as keen as that of a hawk. He must be
able to divine where and when the opposing forward
is about to shoot. All the great goalkeepers
have been of a fearless disposition, practically
throwing themselves at the ball, even at the risk
of receiving a kick from the attacking forward.
Fearlessness is undoubtedly a tremendous asset in
the making of a great goalkeeper. He must also
have a perfect understanding with his backs, and
they must trust him infinitely, which makes his
responsibility all the greater.</p>

<p>I have often been asked the question whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the goalkeeper should train as regularly as any
member of the eleven, and I have replied without
any hesitation "Certainly." In one way he does
not require such a severe course as a half-back,
who has to go through much more work than he
does. He should go in for plenty of short sprinting,
so that when running out of his goal to meet
any forward who has broken through he will be
able to meet the ball quicker than his opponent.
The reason for this is obvious, as half a yard in
twenty will make all the difference between a goal
being scored or not. I do not believe a great deal
in gymnastics for footballers in general, but this
method of training does a goalkeeper a world of
good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">SAVING A &quot;HIGH-FLYER.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>Punch-ball exercises are some of the best he can
practise, and nearly all clubs have a ball fitted up in
their training room. He ought to also practise
place kicking, and endeavour to do so with both
feet. I have often seen a goal scored simply through
a poor return by the goalkeeper. Many allow
one of the backs to take the goal kicks, but this is a
big mistake, as it entails extra work on him, and he
probably has as much to do as he can get
through. I always like to see the ball thrown or
kicked to the wings instead of the centre, where the
play is generally concentrated. It is a mistake to
attempt to punch a ball when it is wet and greasy
and there is plenty of time to give it a lusty kick.
Many a match has been won and lost through the
goalkeeper attempting the former. The inauguration
of the penalty kick has made the position more
difficult than in the olden days. Critics say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
eleven goals should be scored out of twelve. This
is all very well in theory, but in practice it is another
matter. It is, however, from both points of
view a most trying time in any game, especially
when the result of the match depends upon whether
a goal is scored or saved. I shall never forget last
year at Chelsea, when in the closing moments of
the game Notts County were allowed a penalty,
from which they scored.</p>

<p>That goal saved them from going down to the
Second Division of the English League, and also
saved thousands of pounds for the County.</p>

<p>When I was Manager of the 'Spurs I always
made a rule that a goalkeeper should have plenty
of practice in this department. I found that in a
big match things were certainly different, and
especially if there was a large crowd present. The
eye of the multitude is concentrated on the keeper
and the kicker, and there is a great strain on both,
although to my mind the goalkeeper has the advantage
in this way. If a goal is scored no one
blames him, as it is expected. If the forward fails
there is usually a loud groan.</p>

<p>L. R. Roose, the great Welsh International, in
a well-written article for a standard book, has very
well defined the chief duties that fall to his lot.</p>

<p>1. To prevent the ball passing between the space
bounded by the upright posts.</p>

<p>2. To kick off when the ball has been sent behind
the goal-line by one of his opponents.</p>

<p>Another great point where the goalkeeper must
use special discretion is whether to run out to meet
the forward or to "stay at home," as it is called in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
the football world. Undoubtedly if the forward is
clear of the other players he should leave his post
and endeavour to meet the forward. Every yard
he goes out means that he leaves less space to be
guarded. It is a well-known fact that the more
work the goalie has to do the better he shines, and
it often happens that the side that has been
resting for half an hour breaks away and a goal
results. A forward or a half-back is always in the
midst of it, and gets warmed whether his side are
losing or winning, but the keeper has often to exercise
the faculty of patience. There have been many
great goalkeepers, and it is very hard to pick out
even half a dozen who stand out for their fame.
In Scotland, when I was a boy, Macaulay was considered
to be the principal goalkeeper, and quite
deservedly so, if only for the simple reason that in
International matches, especially against England,
he always rose to the occasion. Moon, of the
Corinthians; A. Trainor, of Preston North End;
Toone, of Notts County; and, later on, Sutcliffe, of
Bolton, and Robinson, of Southampton, were always
to the fore, and of the pair it is very
difficult to say which was the better. Both have
played for England on many occasions, and at no
time were they ever disgraced. Their methods in
many ways were different, but the one thing they
had in common was that they both knew the right
moment to go for the ball. Robinson was without
hesitation the more fearless, but Sutcliffe made
up for it in many other ways. I have played
against both on several occasions, and cannot
honestly say that one is greater than the other, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
what one is deficient in the other makes up for
in some other way or by some other method. The
goalkeeper, like the policeman, has a very happy
time in comparison with fifteen years ago. In the
olden days one could practically do as he liked,
and it was not at all uncommon to see the goalie
bundled over the line ere the ball came near him.
He is protected now in every way, and he cannot
now be charged except when in actual contact with
the ball. This is a good rule, and has done a
great deal for the game.</p>

<br />
Full-Back Play.</h2>


<p>One associates the full back with long and lusty
kicking, but he must possess many more qualifications.
He must be speedy, a fine tackler, and,
above all, a good header of the ball.</p>

<p>He must also keep himself thoroughly fit, although
in one way he has not so much to do as
the men in front of him. He must be strong in
defence, but again, when his side is having the
most of the play he should be able to put in many
a good shot. It is also requisite that he should be
able to kick as well with one foot as the other, and
boys especially should study this point. It is
simply a case of practice. Every opportunity
should be utilised in developing the left foot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
which is rather weaker than the other, and every
eleven out of twelve are greatly inclined to use the
right foot, but if you keep on practising, it will
not be long before you will be quite as proficient
with your left as your right. To become a good
artist you must study kicking the ball from any
position or angle that it may come to you. There
is what we call the drop kick, the free kick, the
overhead kick, the place kick, and taking the ball
on the run. The overhead kick is practically one
to be avoided, except in a grave case of emergency,
because you are never certain of it coming off, or
of placing it to any advantage. The drop kick
also takes a great deal of practice to be accomplished
with anything like success, but the essential
thing is to be able to keep the ball on the run
and kick it where you desire. A back should be of
a steady disposition and always keep cool, for if he
loses his head he is of little or no use to the side. It
is also necessary to know when to head or kick
the ball. It is often imperative that a back, for
the good of his side, should punt the ball over the
touch-line, but when doing so he should not make
a lusty kick and put it over the grand stand. All
that is wanted is a gentle touch to the railings,
which is the proper thing to do. As I have already
remarked, to know how to head the ball is
of the utmost importance, and it is effective in
clearing the line, especially from corner kicks.
Heading is quite an art of its own, and takes a
long time to master. You should be able to get at
the ball not only with the forehead, but with either
side of the head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>There should be a general understanding between
the two backs, and also between them and
the goalie. Each should understand the other's
play to a nicety, and cover one another's mistakes
to a certain extent. They must have confidence in
their goalie, and should give him plenty of room
in which to operate. It is also important to know
when to pass back to the goalkeeper, and to do so
correctly. I have seen many goals scored from
faultiness in this respect. In tackling, a back
must be quick in turning, so that if the
forward beats him he has a chance of overtaking
his opponent. This has always been a strong
point in the play of all our greatest backs, and
should be cultivated by all those who wish to
succeed. To the uninitiated it seems that when the
ball comes to a back he should return it vigorously,
and nothing more. This is far from being correct.
Many of our best backs have been moderate
kickers, but when they did kick they did so with
discretion and judgment, placing the ball to the
half-back if he was free or to the outside right or
left, as the run of the play might be. Above all,
a back should be a fine tactician, knowing when to
go for the ball or when to put it quickly into touch,
thus giving his fellow players time to get back and
save the position. There have been many fine
full backs during the last decade of football
history, and probably the greatest were the brothers
Walters, of Corinthian fame; Nick Ross, of Preston
North End; and Walter Arnott, of Queen's Park.
The two Walters understood each other thoroughly,
and as a pair were second to none. Arnott<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
was the prettiest back to watch that I have ever
seen, and Ross was about the most effective. The
latter was certainly the most fearless player that I
have ever run across, and seemed at times to
plough his way through the attacking forwards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

The Middle Line.</h2>


<p>There is no shadow of doubt but that the half-back
line is the backbone of a football team, and
probably the centre half catches the eye more than
any other member of the eleven. He ought really
to be a general, as he is in command of both the
attack and the defence. For, many reasons he
should be the captain of the side, for he can always
encourage either the defence or the attack. He is
like a wicketkeeper in cricket, who sees more of the
game than any other player, and if he be not the
captain, his advice should always be taken into
serious consideration. I have seen so many expert
half-backs that I must refrain from dwelling upon
the abilities of individual players. However, taking
such great examples as C. Campbell, of Queen's
Park, Glasgow; Johnnie Holt, of Everton fame; J.
Cowan, of Aston Villa, now manager of Queen's
Park Rangers, and many others, their methods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
practically agree. A half-back should be able to
distribute the ball when it comes his way to the
best advantage, and a long swinging pass from
centre or outside right or left, according to his
judgment, has always proved most effective. No
one understood this game more than Cowan, and
I am certain others who know the player and game
will testify to this. I prefer a fast man for this
position, if only for the reason that from the kick-off
he gets going invariably before anyone else in
the field. His head work ought to be excellent,
and a great deal depends upon him whether the
run of play be in the opponents' hands or
otherwise. As a matter of fact, the distribution of
play to the best results is practically left to him.
It is a debatable point regarding the halves
whether they should direct their main efforts
against the opposing inside or outside forward.
To my mind, there ought to be an understanding
between the back and the half, but
in theory the half-back should tackle the inside forward
and leave the outside man to the back. The
best of critics disagree on this point, and I only
give my own personal view from the long experience
I have had in playing the game. Still touching
on the wing half, a half-back should certainly
cultivate speed as well as ability, for he must never
know when he is beaten. If a forward outman&oelig;uvres
him, he should instantly fall back on
his own goal, so that when his back tackles the
opposition the half-back should be available to retrieve
the position; that is to say, if the outside left,
for instance, beats the right half-back, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
latter should immediately get between the forward
and the goal post, especially when his
opponent is known to be a dangerous attacker.
It is understood that a half-back has much
more to do in proportion than any other
player in the field, and should always be in the
pink of condition. He has infinitely more running
and twisting about to do, and should be most
elastic. Many wing half-backs are rather prone
to wander all over the field, which is a mistake
(except in isolated cases). Probably E. Needham,
of Sheffield United, was the most adaptable player
in this respect, although H. Wilson, the Scottish
International, ran him close. The mention of the
latter's name brings back to my mind the period
before the law as to throwing in the ball from touch
was altered. Wilson was the expert, and stood
alone. When playing for Sunderland it was
nothing unusual for him to throw the ball from the
half-way line right into the goal-mouth. Much
may have been lost owing to the alteration
in the law, for the player now must stand
with both feet on the line instead of being able
to have a good run ere he parts with the ball.
The half-back should be a good shot, and should
cultivate taking the ball on the run when shooting
at goal. More goals would be scored if the half-backs
did not hesitate but shot straight at the goal.
"The man who hesitates is lost," says a well-known
proverb, and its truth is shown in half-back
shooting as in any other way. Why more goals
do not come from the half-back line is a mystery
to me, but upon reflection I think it is because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
they do not act on the spur of the moment. Still,
this is a failing in the forward line as well as in
the half-back division, and it is hardly fair to
criticise them severely. In summary, my ideal
half-back would be quite as proficient in defence
as in attack, and to secure this result he
will be wise to constantly develop the latter
department, for it is especially true of football that
attack is the best defence. This may seem a
tall order, but a half-back should be both a forward
and a half-back combined. Half-backs
should certainly receive a great deal of assistance,
especially from the forwards, and if this is not
forthcoming it puts an extra amount of work upon
their shoulders. This I shall deal with in another
chapter from a forward's point of view. I cannot
conclude this chapter without alluding to the late
J. Crabtree, who played for many years with Aston
Villa, and upheld his club so well in half-back
and full-back play. I have played against him
on many occasions, and he certainly was the finest
man I ever came across in defence and attack. He
seemed to be able to read the forwards' thoughts,
and knowing what was going to be done with the
ball, intercepted in a way that has rarely, if ever,
been equalled. This, in one way, is a gift which is
not mastered by cultivation, but still practice is a
great thing, and it is only by this means that any
man can hope to come to the front.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<br />
Forward Play.</h2>


<p>A good forward line is perhaps a club's chief
asset. If the forwards continue to attack, the defence
has an easy time, and, as previously mentioned, the
best defence is attack. It is not the man who
scores that is necessarily the best forward, but to get
goals should be the aim of a forward whether he
gets the goal himself or leaves a comrade to
shoot the ball into the net. From this it will be
gathered that a forward should really understand
something of the art of goalkeeping, so that he
may know how best to defeat the goalkeeper.
The object of every forward movement should
be to get to the goal by the nearest way
possible, eluding the goalie by placing the
ball out of his reach. We have all heard of
Johnnie Goodall's method in this line. It is a
well-known fact that he used to put a tall hat on
top of the bar and endeavour to knock it off. In
this way he practically put the ball wherever he
wanted to, and this was the great secret of his
goal-scoring power, which, as I have already remarked,
is the chief asset in a forward. While
we are on the point of shooting, another thing is
to be able to take the ball on the run, which is to
say that a forward should shoot without having to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
trap the ball. By doing so he gives the goalkeeper
no possible chance of knowing where it is
going. If he can do this while running at top
speed, he will certainly be an artist in this department,
and no one was better able to do this than
Stephen Bloomer, the great International. I
have often been asked what was the secret of his
success, and I have always put it down to this
reason: running at top speed and being able to
give the ball&mdash;without slackening down&mdash;the final
kick into the net. In the last decade the forward
line was purely individualist, and there were certainly
many giants of the game. Combination
was, generally speaking, unknown, and every forward
was quite on his own. The forward line is
now a combined one, and in one way it is more
effective than the old style. It is hardly possible
to get a blending of both, but it can be done, and
if a team are fortunate enough to do so they would
certainly come out on top at the end of the season. It
is a recognised fact that the forward play of to-day
is rather too mechanical, and we miss the individual
efforts that we used to appreciate so very
much in the days gone by. Naturally, the centre
forward is the connecting link of the rank. He
should be tall, a fine dribbler, and more often an
individualist than any of his comrades. He should
also be able to keep his wings well together, and
distribute the play to the best advantage, and most
of all to be a fine shot. The inside forwards should
do what is called "the donkey work," to fetch and
carry, and to help the half-backs when they are in
a dilemma. Theirs is the most thankless job of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the lot, and a great deal done by them is often unappreciated.
How often I have heard the crowd cheer
a centre forward for a goal while the man who did
so much to lead up to it was quite overlooked!
Happily he has the consolation of knowing that the
men with him quite appreciate his work, as also does
the educated public. I always try to impress upon
the young and old that it is not the man who scores
the goal that deserves the credit, but that in an
ideal forward line each one should work for the
benefit of the side, treating the getting of the goal as
a mere item of the play. Perhaps, having played
mostly on the inside, I may be inclined to be
biassed. Still, I think not, and I can fortunately
plead my long connection with the game, and I
care not what others may say, this is the <i>esprit de
corps</i> that must prevail in any team which intends
to reach the highest pinnacle in the Association
world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">READY FOR THE KICK-OFF.</span>
</div>

<p>One would imagine that it is the simple duty of
the inside right to pass the ball to his outside man
or on occasions to the centre forward, but this is
far from being correct, and one of the most effective
passes is from inside right to outside left or
vice versa, from inside left to outside right. The
reasons for this are obvious. In the first place, all
the play is concentrated on the right wing, and the
outside left, being correctly placed, passes it with
a long swing to him, and that always means
danger to the opposition. Another reason is that
he retrieves the play to a certain extent by carrying
the play right up the field and so giving the
defence an opportunity to reveal itself. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
inside forward must also come back for the throw-in
when the ball goes out of touch. Coming to
the outside man, he should be able to shoot accurately
from any angle. Often a great failing of
his is running the ball towards the corner flag instead
of making a bee-line for goal. It is given
to few to be able to land the ball in the mouth of
the goal from the corner flag when on the run, and
even if anyone is able to do so, it would certainly
be more effective to make straight for the goal. I
do not believe in an outside forward coming to the
assistance of the defence, save under exceptional
circumstances. An outside may do so and receive
a cheer for it, but it is much more important
that he should be in position to
take up the ball next time it is sent where
he should be waiting. One of the virtues
that an outside man should possess is that of
patience. Often on the run of the play the ball
goes on quite the opposite side of the field, and he
must control the impulse to go after it. It is a
great mistake to leave your place, for when the ball
does come along the outside man will be practically
clear and have a straight run before him. I know
it is a great strain on an outside man to stand still
while all the others are in the thick of the play.
Still, it is his place to do so, and it should be done.
Centring the ball is a great feature, and the best
position from which to do so is about thirty yards
out, landing the ball close upon the twelve
yards line. If he puts the ball further than that
the goalkeeper is in a position to catch it and thus
save the position. The art of being able to place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
corner kicks effectively is a thing of the past.
Perhaps this is due to the restrictions against
charging the goalkeeper unless he is in actual contact
with the ball. Still, it behoves an outside
man to study this point. It may seem strange,
but the best way for the outside right to kick is
with his left foot. The same applies to the outside
left; he should kick with his right foot. The
reason here is surely obvious, because kicks with
your left foot from the right wing cause a slight
swerve on the ball. There have been many great
forwards both in the individual and combination
line. Aston Villa maintain that Archie Hunter
was the greatest centre forward and the best general
that ever kicked a ball, and this statement is endorsed
by very many competent judges. I was
fortunate enough to see him play in Scotland when
on tour twenty years ago, and he very greatly impressed
me. As I was very young at the time,
perhaps I should not make any definite statement.
I have played with G. O. Smith, and he was a
great forward, as also is V. J. Woodward, with
whom I have played in later days. These three
played the game as it should be played. With no
unnecessary charging, they always got on the ball,
and knew when it was best to dribble and when to
shoot. William Bassett, of West Bromwich Albion
fame, was a great outside right, and could centre the
ball from any position. He and Johnnie Goodall,
now manager of Watford, made a great wing.
We all know the abilities of Bloomer, who has
been the greatest goal getter of recent years. The
outside left position is the most difficult one to fill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
in the forward line, and consequently there have
not been so many giants in this position. Probably
this is owing to the fact that few can kick
as well with both feet, but with practice there
should be no difficulty in acquiring this accomplishment.</p>

Training.</h2>


<p>Not the least important thing about football is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
the matter of training, and nearly every professional
club has a trainer, whose business it is not
only to get the men fit, but also to keep them so
for eight months. I have spoken to a great many
whose work it is to get their men into condition
and keep them so, and I find that a great many of
them have different methods, but nearly all are
agreed that every individual must be taken by himself.
The majority of people, however, are not
paid players, although, as I have already said,
these are largely increasing in number, because
year by year we see fresh clubs springing
up, besides which every member of an
ordinary club should be bound to turn out in
as perfect a condition as possible. Many make a
practice of walking to and from their work, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
this in itself is excellent. When Montague Holbein
was training for his Channel swims he used to
make a practice of walking from Catford to the
City, and also back, a distance of several miles,
and this he found very valuable indeed. In the
early days of some of the more important clubs a
great many of the players who were professionals
went to their ordinary occupations all the week and
used to play on a Saturday. When West Bromwich
Albion, captained by William Bassett, won
the English Cup against Preston North End
twenty years ago, the Midlanders were all local
lads, whose wages totalled about ten pounds a week,
while Preston's pay-list was four times as much.
Indeed, men who are regularly at work, especially
if it be out of doors and if it taxes one's bodily
powers, need very little training. No one ought to
play football unless he has a sound constitution, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
every organ in the body must be sound, especially
the heart and lungs; it is a game for those who
are healthy and vigorous. A good plan is to
pursue some exercise during the "close" season,
<i>i.e.</i>, the summer months. Professionals will
tell you that August is their hardest month,
a large number of them having done nothing
since the end of April. Their muscles
have become stiff, and they have probably too
much surplus flesh. It is very different where
professionals take up first class cricket, and trainers
have frequently told me that those professionals
and amateurs who play the summer game require
little or no preparation, and there are many instances
of that. Take, for instance, J. Sharp, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
famous Everton forward. He must be getting on
in years, and yet season after season he plays
cricket up till the end of August and then turns
up at Goodison Park and shows how well he
can carry the ball along and whip it into goal,
like "a rocket, though not so straight up," as one
great judge has written of him. He has been an
International this year. He has done splendid
work as a cricketer, and is second on the list of
Lancashire averages, and may be described as one
of the greatest all-round men in England. Now,
in his thirty-first year, he has given evidence that
if you keep in condition there is no need to worry
about special preparation or anything of the sort.
Another instance is E. Needham, the captain of
Sheffield United, and perhaps the greatest half-back
for many years that we have had. He is now
thirty-five, and it is a long time since he played
his first International match, and long before he
was a cricketer he had made his name as a footballer.
He is a tireless worker, as anyone who
has watched him with the Sheffield United club
knows quite well, and long before his age many
men have retired from the game. He has the
respect and admiration of everyone, and this year
he has come to the front as a cricketer and finished
at the head of the Derbyshire averages. The
result of his always keeping in condition is that
he will probably go on for some years as a great
cricketer, and as one career is on the wane the other
seems to be beginning. He is great indeed at
both games. Two other members of the Sheffield
United club have also made their presence felt at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the summer game. I refer to the two half-backs,
the brothers Wilkinson. W. H., the half-back,
has never done better as a cricketer. He is a left-handed
batsman, and has made a great advance
on anything he has done before, while B. Wilkinson
is a player of some repute. Lewis, of Somerset;
Makepeace, of Lancashire; Ducat, of Surrey;
Iremonger, of Notts; and Leach and Vincett, of
Sussex, are all cricketers who have done splendid
work during the summer game, and have turned
out footballers perfectly fit at the beginning of
the season. Indeed, if you play cricket as it should
be played it is magnificent training for football.
It is hard work getting fit at the start of the season
if you have allowed your muscles to become
flabby, while there may be no regular circulation
of the blood, and generally the muscles that you
require are very lethargic, so the difficulty is with
those who do not play tennis or cricket, or go in
for rowing or swimming or some other form of
active exercise during the summer, that they will
have to take up some serious practice. Skipping
is good, walking and running, especially short
sprinting, while punch-ball exercise and dumb-bells
may be used. There should be moderation in
all things, and one must start carefully at first and
increase the amount of training until one feels fit.
During the season walking and some practice at
kicking, with an occasional sprint, are quite
enough to keep the player well. It is quite possible
that some may suffer from the tremendous
amount of energy that they put into their game. I
do not think that those who work indoors, such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
clerks and others who are called upon to follow indoor
occupation, require more than moderate
regular exercise. It is very likely that they will
have to do their training after or before business
hours, and in the evening brisk walking of a
couple of miles, with a sprint of 100 yards four
or five times, is a good way of getting rid
of superfluous fat, and everyone can do this if he
likes, though laziness will often lead some to shield
themselves under the excuse, "They have no
time." One well-known forward, thoroughly
conscientious in his training, used to exercise on
the Embankment, an excellent plan. Everyone
who has to work sitting down should take a morning
bath and a little practice with a skipping rope
or dumb-bells. The question of diet is of some
importance. The game is so strenuous and exhausting
that a substantial meal should be taken
at least two hours before a match. Many have a
beef steak well cooked, with stale bread and vegetables
that are well done, always excluding
potatoes, and they are able to play right through
the game without feeling in any way fatigued.
The plainer the food the better. All players are
better if they leave alone intoxicants. Needham
earnestly advises young players to abstain from
them. He says that his experience is that they do
not sustain any long continued effort, and their
stimulating effect is followed by an invariable
depression. From my own observation of players
who have abstained and those who have not, I am
sure the former have done far better than the latter.
Plenty of Internationals and men whose names are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
household words are total abstainers. I remember
Vivian J. Woodward at a dinner in the football
season would neither touch intoxicating drinks nor
smoke, and England's captain knew what he was
about. Kirwan, who captained Ireland; John
Goodall, one of the props of the game; John
Lewis, the famous penalty king; C. Williams, the
Brentford and Tottenham goalkeeper; Ducat, of
Woolwich Arsenal, are only a few of the total abstainers,
and to them I might add R. M. Hawkes,
International and the Luton captain. Indeed, if
you want to be of the greatest value to your side
you may take it from me that you will do better
service by leaving alone all sorts of alcohol, and as
to smoking, I am quite sure it is thoroughly bad.
I see one picture which explains to me why a great
deal of the slackness is creeping over our boys.
Again and again I have watched mere lads of
fourteen and fifteen, as well as young men of
twenty-five, come on to the cricket and football
field smoking those horrible, cheap, inferior
"fags." How any captain can allow it is a great
mystery to me, because if we are training for a match
we always say do not smoke a day or two before,
because it interferes with one's staying powers.
Yet I have seen boys come down to Tottenham
smoking all the way from London, all the time
they are changing, and actually come from the
dressing room with cigarettes, and blow and blow
away right to the moment of kicking off. Not
content with that, they get through some more
cigarettes at the interval, and then wonder why they
are tired before the match is over. I have often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
begged of our youths if they wish to be athletes to
remember that it means a certain amount of self-denial,
and if they want to do their best for their
side they will take this matter seriously to heart
and remember that smoking and drinking intoxicants
make one unfit rather than otherwise. I do
not think that the ordinary player need think about
special training, but if, on the other hand, staleness
comes to him a complete rest is necessary.
When you are overworked at the end of a long
season your feet will seem heavy and your kicking
will be uncertain, while you will fall and stumble
about. This is the time to retire and make room
for someone else. With a little care you will gain
the necessary freshness, and you will be able to
tell when you have got that, because you will be
anxious to play the game.</p>

Hints to Junior and Amateur Clubs.</h2>


<p>It is an old adage that the boy is father to the man,
and this applies casually to football circles. The
boy of to-day has a great advantage over a boy of
say ten or fifteen years ago. Every possible
opportunity is put in his way for developing his
play, as schoolmasters take a bigger interest in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
their boys than in olden days. Schoolboy Internationals
and shield competitions are the order of
the day, while years ago boys used to meet together,
pick sides, put their jackets down for posts,
and go full speed ahead without any referee or
any official. I have followed closely these schoolboy
competitions, and in my heart think they are
really a mistake. A boy of twenty years ago had
to do all the initial work, which amounted to carrying
the goal-posts to the field of play, whether it
were a common or any other open space. They had
to find their own ball, and many times I have given
a few pence to an aspiring club. The blowing up
of the ball was another great event, and in those
days it took a lot of doing, the youth with the
strongest and biggest lungs having the privilege
of giving the ball its last few blows. The captain
always had the honour of carrying the ball to the
field of play, and could do practically what he
liked with it. Nowadays things seem completely
altered. The boy, instead of doing everything for
himself, has everything done for him, and all he
has to do is simply turn up in time to change and
go on to the field of play. I think this is a great
mistake, and if the youth of to-day had to go out
of his way to a great extent for his Saturday
pastime he would be all the better for it. When
I was a youngster it was nothing unusual for an
enthusiast to get out of bed at an unearthly hour
in the morning and make all the preparations for
the day's game, go back to breakfast, and then
turn up at the office at the usual time. To do this
one must be very fond of the game, and such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
spirit will carry any club or player right to the
front. I have been secretary to both amateur and
professional clubs, and my sympathy goes out to
the secretary of the first-named. The professional
secretary or manager has only to say to the player
"Do this," and he does it, like the centurion of old,
but the man who holds the reins of an amateur
club has to put up with many disappointments
through the thoughtlessness of members of his
team. I should like to put this point very
strongly before these players, and ask them to consider
their secretary in every way. Charles Reade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
wrote a very fine novel, <i>Put Yourself in His
Place</i>, and this applies to the case in point. The
hon. secretary of an amateur club as a rule is a
very busy man, and takes the position from mere
love of the game. It must be admitted that it is
rough on him to find on Saturday morning that
many players cannot put in an appearance at the
match and could have saved him all the trouble of
wiring and sending round the district for another
player if they had only let him know a day or two
before, so that he would have had a chance of filling
the places they had vacated. It means a great
deal of trouble to him which, for the sake of a little
thought, could have easily been avoided. I am
speaking feelingly now, and if any player happens
to read this chapter I hope he will consider this
matter seriously. Junior and amateur clubs have
a few failings that I might be permitted to point
out. I might start in the first place with punctuality.
Although this is considered by many a
virtue, it is not so considered by them. Probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
before a match starts twenty players have to wait
for the dilatoriness of the other two. Of course
there are exceptional circumstances which are excusable,
but the unpunctuality of the players in
junior and amateur matches has done a great deal
of harm from a spectatorial point of view. Professional
clubs soon realise this point, and much of
their success in league matches is due to players
and officials being invariably ready to start at the
advertised time of kick off. If a professional is
late a severe penalty is imposed upon him, and the
Football League are most autocratic in knowing
that the referee and linesmen are always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
there at the correct time, and if they are late they
are liable to be fined. Regarding training for
juniors, it only behoves a boy to be thoroughly
fit and well. If he indulges in some summer game,
such as cricket, tennis, or golf, or if he plays
regularly lawn tennis, he should start the season
quite fit and well. If, however, he feels in the
summer not inclined to follow any of these pastimes,
he ought to go in for walking or swimming,
so as to reduce his weight, and thus enable him
to go on the field and play as usual. In recent years
one has heard and read a great deal about special
training, and I may remark that special training
is not really necessary, even from a professional
point of view. What is necessary is to keep the
players well together, regular hours for meals,
and off to bed in good time. It is the <i>esprit de
corps</i> that must be cultivated. The junior who is
at business all the week should require but little
training. His match on the Saturday, if he leads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
a regular life, should be quite sufficient to enable
him to turn up on that day as fit as possible. Still,
if he has a little time to spare a few short sprints
once or twice a week will do him a great deal of
good. He may probably add two or three yards
in a hundred, and speed is a great asset in
modern football. Probably one yard in twenty is
of infinitely more advantage than say five in a
hundred, and for that reason alone I have always
encouraged a player, if he can possibly do so, to
go in for short sprints from twenty-five yards to
fifty. Should he not be able to run on an open
piece of ground there would be no harm in putting
on a pair of canvas shoes at home and sprinting
for fifty yards on the pavement opposite his house
or on the road if the district is fairly quiet.
Nobody will take any notice, especially after the
first once or twice, and on coming indoors take
a hot bath; if going out again never forget to
have a cold plunge afterwards. I am a great
believer in hot baths for taking away any
nasty knock or soreness, but they must be taken
with the greatest possible care so as to avoid catching
cold. There is no finer sensation after having
a hot bath than to jump into a stone cold one or
to stand under a shower. It makes you tingle all
over, and after having a rub down you feel like a
giant refreshed. "Am I a believer in Turkish
baths?" is a question often asked me, and I
must admit that I generally qualify my reply.
Once now and again does no harm; to indulge in
them regularly to me seems a great mistake, as
they are certainly most lowering. Another point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
I should like to dwell upon is that the junior of
to-day makes a practice of playing with his cap on,
especially in wet weather. I must honestly state
that I hate to see anyone playing with a headgear.
It seems to me strange, and I know many a player
who has caught a very bad cold through playing
in this way, and after changing, going home in
the same. If he has a change it is not so bad,
but it takes a longer time for this cap to dry than
his hair, and it is some considerable time before
the former is fit to wear after getting soaked. Just
a word in conclusion to the juniors. Play the
game as it should be played. Do not hold your
opponents up to ridicule by beating them two or
three times when once will suffice. Get as many
goals as you possibly can, for a team will prefer
to be beaten by double figures rather than know
that their opponents were toying with them and
could score whenever they chose. Be loyal to
your club and clubmates, and do not forget that
enthusiasm is the great thing that will carry you
to the front in football as well as in other
spheres in life. Unselfishness is also another great
point. Should your captain or committee choose
another man as your superior, do not grumble,
but turn out for the second eleven, and play with
all your heart and soul, and if you have the merit
you will soon regain your old position in the first
team. Above all, play the game fairly and
squarely, and you will succeed either as a professional,
senior, junior, or amateur.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<br />
Captaincy.</h2>


<p>There are a good many people who think that the
office of captain is not very important, but my
idea is that the judicious choice of a skipper is
very great indeed. I have heard it said that the
office is an empty honour in a professional club,
but I am sure that this is a great mistake, and in
an ordinary club as much depends on the leader as
all the rest put together. The best players in the
world are sacrificed if placed under an inefficient
general, but on the other hand a leader of ability
and energy has often made a strong club out of
what seemed to be very unpromising material. So
the best all-round player should be skipper. It
seems to me quite necessary that whoever holds
this position must have the confidence of every
member of the side, and there can only be one
leader in the field, and unless any fellow has ability
and character enough to gain the loyal support of
his men, he had certainly better never think about
taking the office. So many clubs fail because they
have no confidence in their leaders. Ernest Needham,
the great leader of the Sheffield United side,
has said that when a team is in a winning mood
how proud the captain may be, but what a difficult
post he has to fill when a team is on the downward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
grade and losing match after match. The man
you choose should have a thorough knowledge of
the game, and also enthusiasm and keenness,
which should be a standing rebuke to that subtle
spirit of slackness which is so characteristic of our
men to-day. Personally, I am very sorry to see
this, and if you have at the head one who sets
an example of hard work, coolness, and determination,
you may be sure that he will do his best to
get all he can out of his men. "Example is far
better than precept." Now the captain should be
the oldest member of a team as a rule, and the one
with most experience. Alexander Tait and Walter
Bull, when they were leaders of the 'Spurs, were
examples of ability and experience going hand in
hand, and they naturally commanded respect. As
a rule the captain should decide on the composition
of the team and what they should do. If he has
an idea he can improve it by giving a few new men
a trial, he should inform his committee, who
in a small club should always be men who have
played and know the game. They, too, must have
perfect confidence in the man they have chosen,
and allow him a very free hand if they wish to
get the best results. One caution which has often
been uttered but each season seems to need repetition,
is this that when the side is playing the
captain has absolute control of his men, and is
responsible for their formation and play. He
should be above favouritism, for in junior clubs the
leader has often favourites, and no matter how
very able the man may be himself one player does
not make a team, and it is necessary to be friendly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
with all and not be partial to anybody. The game
and the ability of each for his particular part in it
must be the chief consideration, and I hope that
this will ever be so. Without it there will be no
success. Again, it is very necessary that a
captain should be in a position to be able to point
out the errors of each one, so that there may be
no resentment. On the field of play, too, he must
feel that he has the support of his men, because
it is when they are playing matches that he has
great responsibility. He will carefully watch for
openings on the part of the opposing club, and if
he thinks he detects a weak place, will direct the
play so as to take advantage of this and
gain the upper hand, giving his comrades
hints as to how this may be done. Many
captains that I know of hardly speak a word
on the field of play, but the interval forms a very
useful opportunity indeed for advice, which must
be taken in the proper spirit. He will watch the
play of his opponents, and adopt what he thinks
will be the best game. Ernest Needham remembers
how in the great Cup-tie, Sheffield United
against Liverpool, his side were, ten minutes from
the close of play, two goals down, and then played
eight forwards, one back, and one half-back,
and in this way managed to get a drawn game.
Of course, as he explains, goals against them mattered
little, but the Liverpool forwards were soon
offside in their attempt to break away. In this
case the captain was in a weak position, and
reverted to what may seem a strange formation in
order to save the day. Two great captains who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
have left their mark upon the game have been
Howard Spencer and V. J. Woodward. Spencer
was the leader of Aston Villa, and he gained his
unique position by qualities that may well be
imitated. He was something more than an English
gentleman and sportsman. He was, perhaps, the
fairest player ever known to the game. He has
never been known to lose his temper, and self-restraint
seemed to him perfectly natural. No
player or referee has ever accused him of a wilful
foul, and he has nothing except honest and
straightforward play and skill. His knowledge of
the game was very great, and is shown by the fact
that his club won the League Championship four
times, while three times in ten years he helped
Aston Villa to win the English Cup. I dare say,
like the rest of humanity, he had faults, but at the
same time he stood out a man who was a brainy
player of great ability. The other man is V. J.
Woodward, who has hardly reached the zenith of
his fame. He is very fair in his play, and is ever
heartily welcomed by those who have the pleasure
of his acquaintance. It was a mere accident that
brought him to the front. A Tottenham supporter
happened to see him taking part in a local
game at the time when G. O. Smith was retiring,
and he was invited to show his prowess in good
company, with what result everybody knows. If
he has been left out of a side it is perhaps because
he is so unselfish that he has not been chosen on
every occasion that he might have been, but nature
and skill asserted themselves, and he is the unanimous
choice of the selectors now. He would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
rather lose a game than win it by dirty tactics. He
is never individual, and always gives the others a
chance. To my mind, he is the ideal captain of
the day, and everyone who wishes to be successful
as a leader should go and watch him. The
young player must always remember to
keep perfect control over his temper, or he
will do very little. Walter Bull thinks the
ideal place for a "skipper" is that of centre half,
but some others have preferred the goalkeeper's
place. In the latter you have all the play before
you, but from centre half hints can be passed unobserved
to the front line. Alexander Tait, of
Leyton, was ever quiet as a captain, no shouting
on the field of play, but a friendly "tip" during
the interval. What you regard as "hard lines"
will often try your temper, but if you expect your
side to obey the referee and the spectators to behave
well, you must show the way. The skipper
who succeeds is the man of few words on the field,
though off it he may say a great deal. The club's
affairs will go much more smoothly if he tries to be
fair. No personal feeling must interfere with his
choice of a player&mdash;the best man for the position,
and the one who plays not for himself but for his
side. To-day combination is required. I know
one brilliant International who was very individual.
Remonstrances were of no use, and at last came
the time when he had to be left out of the team.
He was a nice fellow, and since he left he has been
captain for his country. One man, good as he
may be, cannot win a match, and the captain, at
least, should be free from reproach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<br />
The Referee.</h2>


<p>In one way the most important man on the field is
the referee, as the success of the game depends a
great deal on his ability to control the play and
players adequately. He is commonly known as
the "Knight of the Whistle," and his responsibilities
are manifold. To be a successful referee
one must keep thoroughly fit, and be able to turn
out on to the field in as good a condition as the
player does, for he has got to go through more
running than any of the twenty-two players, and
must keep up with their pace. Like Cæsar's wife,
he should be above suspicion, and give his decisions
without fear or favour. It is the weak
referee that often spoils a game and brings football
into disgrace.</p>

<p>Refereeing in a first class match is much easier
than taking the whistle in what we might call junior
ones. In senior circles players know the game
from "A" to "Z," and play accordingly; but
often a referee has to use more judgment than if
he were officiating for the English Cup at the
Crystal Palace. However, this is only by the
way, and I must dwell upon the senior referee more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
than the junior. In brief, my ideal referee must
have the following qualifications:&mdash;</p>

<ol>
<li>A thorough knowledge of the rules of the
game.</li>

<li>Be strong minded enough to enforce his decisions
when once they are given.</li>

<li>He should have been a player himself, and
still be as active as ever on the field.</li>

<li>He must be an autocrat. (If necessary, the
F.A. will support him to the fullest extent
possible.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Really the duties of a referee are manifold. He
has full control of the play, and must use a great
amount of tact, for if he does not, he not only spoils
the game but his own reputation. He should be
quick in giving his decisions, and must adhere to
them, despite the grumblings and comments of the
players or spectators. The professional footballer
of to-day is very quick in weighing up the referee.
He knows in his heart whether he can do as he
likes or if the referee is to be obeyed. Supposing
the man with the whistle is weak, no one knows
better than the players, and again, if he is strong,
they know they can take no liberties during the
course of the game. In ordinary games the
referee must be strong and have no connection with
the clubs engaged. The most able referees that I
have played under or witnessed were men who
were slow to speak, but when occasion arose were
quick to act. As a matter of fact, they have simply
to say "Do this," and it is done; and there is
trouble for anyone who endeavours to dispute their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
ruling. The greatest referee may make mistakes.
Still, he must maintain the dignity of his decisions
when once given. In many ways a referee is born
and not made, and all the best referees are those
who have played the game when they were young,
and have followed it up continually since leaving
off, actually taking part in the kicking of the ball.
Their hearts are in the game, and this makes all the
difference, to a great degree, whether they are successful
or not. In senior circles referees are supposed
to be unbiassed, which I am glad to say in
the general run of cases they are. The crowd of
the home side are naturally in favour of their
friends, and the referee has often to put up with
any amount of comment and ridicule. It is then
that he should show his character and worth by
distributing the law of the game as it ought to be
done in all honesty and fairness.</p>

<p>Probably it may be considered vanity on my
part to give the would-be referee a few ideas from
a player's point of view. A referee should, if
possible, know each man by name and the position
he occupies in the field, so that if a reprimand is
necessary he can say, "Jones or MacPherson,
stop that!" A little phrase like that goes a very
long way, and I may attribute the secret of some
of our referees' success to knowing the names of
the players they are refereeing, and so being able
to call them personally to order when necessary.</p>

<p>The relation of the referee to the linesmen is a
very great question, and whether he should be persuaded
by the two men on the line has often been
discussed both on and off the field. To sum it up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
briefly, my opinion is that a referee should act
upon his own discretion, but when in doubt should
consult his linesmen. If he gives a decision on
the spur of the moment when he is certain he is
quite correct, he must not be persuaded by the
opposition one way or the other. Still, when he is
in doubt he should certainly appeal to the linesmen,
and the referee who does not do so is bound to get
into bad odour. The linesman is closely connected
with the referee in every way, although his duties
are not really arduous. In reality, he has simply
to follow the ball up the field, give his decision
as to whether the sphere has gone over the lines,
and to say which side should have the benefit, and
whether a corner kick should be given or not.</p>

<p>Of recent years the penalty kick has often been
a great trouble to the referee, and should a man be
forgiven for overlooking a certain foul it must be
decided by the opinion of the man on the line.
The penalty kick is probably the most difficult
point the referee of to-day has to deal with, and he
should give it instantly with the courage of his
convictions, and even if the decisions of his linesmen
are different. Quickness and decision are
what is really wanted in a referee.</p>

<p>Just a word or two to the spectators. They
should not judge quickly or harshly, and should
always recognise that it is one man that must decide,
rightly or wrongly. They must not overlook
the fact that he has got to do so on the spur of
the moment, and that he has no time for reflection.
Whilst dwelling on the subject of referees, it is a
matter of regret that many players do not take any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
interest in junior circles, where their personality
would command respect. The boy of to-day, knowing
that a certain International is going to officiate
in the game he is taking part in, will play much
better than if Tom, Dick, or Harry had the control,
a fact which proves for itself that personality is a
great thing in the "Knight of the Whistle." John
Lewis, of Blackburn, has been crowned King of
Referees, and undoubtedly this was greatly due to
his personality on the field. The player knew he
could take no liberties whatever, and when a warning
was once given it was given so that the player
was sure that his next act of disobedience would
ensure for him his marching order off the field,
and that later he would be dealt with by the F.A.
Mr. Lewis always let the player know when he had
gone too far in any way, and afterwards it was for
a player to see that it did not occur again. It is
a pity that more first-class players, when they have
finished their playing career, do not follow it up
by becoming referees. Referees of the class of
Major Marindin, J. C. Clegg, J. J. Bentley, and
many others, are badly wanted in the football of
to-day. I might appeal to the older players to
take a greater interest in the beginners than they
are doing at the present time. They should remember
the days when they were young and the
interest taken in them by their elders, who used
to go out of their way to encourage them in their
sport, and endeavour to do to-day what was done
for them years ago. Junior referees are badly
wanted, especially men of a reputation that is well
respected. I, even in my little way, refereeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
last year, found my name and fame as a Cup-holder
and International was a great recommendation,
and called for the respect that is really due to
worthy officials. If this appeals to any player it is
easy for him to become a referee by applying to his
local association. The biggest bugbear that the
referee has to contend with is the penalty and offside
restrictions. To the uninitiated the offside rule
appears quite simple, but to the referee it is the most
difficult problem he has got to overcome during
the course of the day. His eye is always on the
ball, and whilst following it up quickly he is naturally
inclined to miss some point which appeals to
the onlookers, every one of whom considers himself
a critic. The penalty kick plays an important
part in the game of to-day, and this particular
point requires instant decision, consequently the
referee needs to be a man with good judgment, and
one who is not to be deterred by criticism, whether
it be by players, spectators, or directors.</p>

<br />
Football as a Profession.</h2>


<p>There are many young fellows who are inclined
to take up football as a profession, and to these the
writer would say, "Count well the cost before you
do it." I have spoken to many players, and few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
would let their boys take football up as the serious
business of life. It is easy to start; any club that has
paid players will give you a trial, and if you are
capable will sign you on at perhaps a few shillings
up to a pound a week. The objections are that
the career is very short, and may be interrupted or
terminated by an accident at any time, and then
if you are not master of a trade you are practically
ruined. When boys used to come to me and tell
me of their wish to join the 'Spurs I always tried
to get them to learn some trade first and be master
of it, so when necessary they could fall back upon
it. This provision for the future is necessary, because
you may begin your paid career at seventeen
or eighteen, before you have learned a trade, and
play on till you are twenty-eight or thirty,
and then find you are too old to begin to do so.
I have known a number who had made no preparation
for the future, and in some cases they are
starving. It is one of the painful duties of a secretary's
life to have to hear of appeals for help from
veterans who have neglected to acquire some trade
before taking up football. No club ought to be
allowed, for the credit of the game, to sign on
any players until they have given evidence that they
have a marketable knowledge of some trade or profession.
As I have said, many think £4 a week
is a nice income; so it is, but how many get it,
and how many years does it last? It may be that
in the near future you may get as much as you can
out of a club, but even then only a very few of the
thousands of paid players will get more than
they do now. Many a youth, talking of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
matter, has been under the impression that
all professionals get the £4 per week. That
is not so. Many of the smaller clubs cannot
afford to pay it. There are many who never get
beyond 50s. per week. No doubt the organisation
of school games has had a great deal to do with
turning the attention of promising lads at school
to football as a career. It is true that one out of
a thousand schoolboy players may get signed on,
but I hardly know of half a dozen. Hundreds of
young men apply to clubs for a trial, and are soon
convinced that they have not skill enough, but
those few who are lucky should weigh the matter
seriously. I know there are many who may argue
that they can, after their playing days are over,
get a position as trainer or manager to some club.
Such a place as I had, for instance, for many
years, but, like everything else nowadays, there are
only a very limited number of these positions,
while there are scores of applicants for them, and
for every vacancy to be filled there are generally
one or two who have very strong backing, and
there is little chance for the outsider. Others have
often pointed out to me that after a certain number
of years they will be entitled to a benefit. This is
quite correct, but even if the benefit comes off
how much does it bring in? I should fancy that an
average benefit does not give more than £300 or
£400&mdash;indeed, a footballer is considered very lucky
if the match that he has chosen brings him £150.
I have known a great many that have brought in
less. Mr. J. J. Bentley, who is now the President
of the Football League, once wrote an article on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
"Football Finance," in which he stated that "not
more than six professional clubs were solvent," and
he asked the pertinent question: "If only six of the
leading clubs can make it pay on a really lucrative
scale, what is to become of the game?" By the
game he doubtless means the professional part of
it. Fourteen years have passed away, but I very
much doubt if the situation is altered now. A few
clubs, a very few, make a profit on their year's
working. The majority show a deficit which annually
becomes larger. For a time collapse is
avoided by the bazaar or by turning the club into
a limited liability company, but these are only temporary
reliefs, and the fact remains that in most
clubs either the expenses of management or the
salaries of the players are larger than the receipts
permit, and sometimes the clubs go under.
Another important point for the would-be "pro."
is the question of temperament. You must have
exceptional qualities of a personal character.
If you cannot take hard knocks as well as
give them, and if you cannot control your temper,
you are not likely to be successful. The day of
the blackguardly dirty player is over, and the man
with brain as well as brawn is needed for this
work. Education makes all the difference, and the
incoming professionals will have to be men of considerable
culture. Neither is there any chance for
the fellow who cannot control his appetite in the
matter of strong drink. There arise before us
sad and mournful pictures of men whose names
have been "familiar as a household word," but
whose sun has set years before it should have done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
owing to the fact that they soaked in beer. Some
I have seen at the Palace in the Cup Final, the
heroes of the day; apparently the world was at their
feet. The next time one set eyes on them it was
difficult to recognise in the battered specimen of
humanity that stood before you the sprightly player
of former days. The contrast is painful, but often,
very often, has greeted my eyes.</p>

<p>"No," said a great Southern League captain to
me, "my boys shall never be paid footballers,
but they must learn a trade. The prospects are
not pleasing enough." No, it is far better, unless
you have superlative talents, to take to some other
calling. It is only a small proportion who make
their mark in professional football.</p>

<p>Some may make a better thing out of it if they
are paid cricketers, for they will have wages for
both games. But here again the area is limited,
though the pay is good. It is not necessary to be
a professional player to gain the highest honours.
Take England's captain, V. J. Woodward; he is
an architect, but from the first day I saw him there
was great ability, and it was bound to come out.
So with many other amateurs who have come to
the front. They have succeeded because they had
skill, but also because they kept in good condition
owing to their ordinary work, which was well done.
To boys I say stick to your job, and having worked
well go and play your best. But leave professionalism
out of the business.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

Continental Football: Its Growth and
Possible Developments.</h2>


<p>Football on the Continent is undoubtedly
developing greatly, and a great deal of credit is
due to the enterprise of the English and Scottish
clubs. I have played in France, Germany, and
Austria, and the enthusiasm displayed by the
players and spectators holds forth great hopes of
the game becoming as popular on the other side
of the Channel as it is here. It is a few years ago
since I last played there, and since then great
developments have taken place, such as International
matches with English and foreign sides.
Practically the results have always been in our
favour, but gradually the margin in the goals is
becoming less. It will take many years yet before
we can expect the Continentals to be able to give
our English teams a real good game. However,
the outlook is very rosy, as the enthusiasm is becoming
greater week by week and year after year.
The British elevens who used to visit the Continent
were inclined to look upon it as a holiday trip.
But after seeing the good done by these visits they
have played more earnestly than hitherto.</p>

<p>While playing in Austria, I was greatly im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>pressed
with the spirit of our opponents. They
were keen enough to learn, and wished to know
precisely how the game was played. The captain
of the native team (by the way, he could speak
English) came to our captain and requested him to
play the game as it should be played, and get as
many goals as we could and not toy with them.
We won by at least double figures, but at the finish
of the match they called for three cheers for us,
and of course we naturally responded. This is
the spirit that prevails from my little knowledge of
foreign football, and if it is continued there can
be no doubt that at a future date they will be able
to challenge any English or Scottish teams, and
would give them a good game. It is rather
awkward not knowing the language when playing
on the Continent, as often times one would like to
know exactly why such a decision was given. It
has often had its ludicrous side, and I have often
smiled at the broad Scotchman trying to explain
something to a German without any success.</p>

<p>Refereeing is probably the point that wants
more cultivating than even playing, and any
amount of games have been spoiled by an official
coming on to the field, not following the ball, and
giving his decisions autocratically. He was generally
dressed immaculately, and did not dream of following
the run of play, and in many cases he has spoiled
what would have been a good game. It is to be
regretted that there have been some scenes on the
Continent reminiscent of some of our outbreaks on
home grounds. In one way this is certainly deplorable,
but in another it shows that the game is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
catching on on the Continent, the players showing
a better appreciation of the rules, just as they are
able to follow the rules of the game; and now what
is wanted is an Association in every country just
like the F.A. in England. The International games
to be played at the Stadium this year have shown
the decided taste of other countries for all kinds of
sports that are played here, and as the matter now
stands Great Britain should certainly come out
first, but it is a matter of great speculation
whether Sweden, Germany, Italy, France, or
Austria will finish second. The countries mentioned
are most enthusiastic about it, and great
credit must be given to the F.A. for the magnificent
sum they have contributed towards the
entertainments of the visitors. In South Africa
the game has been played longer than in any
country outside the British Isles. The competition
there is known as the Donald Currie Cup,
and it is nothing unusual for a team to travel
a thousand miles to take part in this competition.
In conversation the other day with a player who
has played a great deal there, he said the English
footballer of to-day could not do well there, for
the travelling on the rough roads and the hard
ground would be quite unlike anything they experience
in England. Argentina is a great many
miles away, but the game there is also developing
rapidly. It is only three years ago since
Southampton undertook the long voyage and had
a most enjoyable time. It must be said that they
astonished the natives, but this missionary effort
by one of the leading clubs in the country is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
making the game popular all over the world.
The Corinthians, too, have done a great deal in
this way. They have been to Africa, and practically
all over the world, and wherever they have
been they have given an excellent exposition of how
the game should be played. In South Africa
they had perhaps to play with more vigour,
the ground being as hard as asphalte, and the
trying conditions affecting the play, but they nearly
always came out top. France is stronger in Rugby
than in Association Football, but the International
matches between the two countries make the latter
more popular with the public. The season in
many countries on the Continent is about half as
long as ours, and this makes all the difference to
them, but it will be a long time before any Continental
country will be able to claim supremacy.</p>

<br />
Football Reform.</h2>


<p>Has Association Football reached its zenith?
"Certainly not," is the reply I invariably give to
any enthusiast or cynic who asks me the question.
Remember, there are a good many reforms that
must be made, for a game must keep up its position
and also retain its popularity with the masses,
who are the mainstay of football. As I have al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>ready
remarked, I have a great respect for the F.A.,
and they have a great deal to do with the game
which is recognised now as the game of the
country. It is much easier to criticise than to
legislate, and much of the work done by these associations
does not get the credit it deserves. Facts
are stubborn things, and when my old club,
Tottenham Hotspur, played in the English Cup
Final, at the Crystal Palace, in April, before a
record crowd of 114,000, it was said that these
figures would never be beaten. It certainly has
not been done in England, although it has been
very nearly approached, but last April, at Hampden
Park, it was overshadowed by 20,000 more onlookers.
Cricket has had an infinitely longer
innings than football, but I can see no just reason
nor impediment why football, especially Association,
should not go on for at least the lifetime of the
present generation. The majority of sports, such
as cycling, running, etc., have died through the
want of proper management, and sports as a whole
should be controlled by an Association of Amateurs
in the proper sense of the word. Probably it is
not known to many of my readers that the F.A.,
to save the game from falling into the hands of a
speculator, have restricted the dividends to be
paid to any club to 5 per cent. By the way, this
rule does not apply to Scotland, but before long
I hope they will follow in the steps of their English
brethren. Again, to show how pure professional
clubs are, directors, whether they be five or fifteen,
are not entitled to draw any money from the club,
and this shows that the real sportsmanlike spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
prevails at the helm of professional football, and
certainly no reform in this way is desired or required.
Rumours of a National League are quite
rife in the air, but on going into the matter, I
hardly see any desirability for the idea bearing
fruit. For one reason, if it did come off it would
become very speculative, and, like the big trusts in
America have done, do much damage to the smaller
tradesmen. Even look at the possibility of such
a great league when one comes to deal with the
matter thoroughly from a geographical point of
view, and I have spent many hours in endeavouring
to see how such a league could become workable.
Rivalry in football is one of its biggest
assets, and in this way I should like to see the
big Southern clubs formed into a Southern
League and the Northern clubs into a Northern
League, and the two top clubs of each League
to fight out the question of supremacy. As I have
already stated, I consider that the present governing
body of Association football is admirably constituted,
and it will be a sorry day for the game if
the leading clubs rebel. At the same time, systems
are rarely if ever perfect, so I should like to make
a few suggestions upon the following points:</p>

<ol>
<li>The transfer system.</li>

<li>The wage limit.</li>

<li>Neutral referees should be appointed by an
independent body of the Association.</li></ol>

<p>Dealing firstly with the transfer system, I think
it is iniquitous, and when the Players' Union was
first formed this was one of the burning questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
of the day. I fought the matter out strenuously,
because at that time the rules of the F.A. were
contrary to the League. As secretary I appealed
to the F.A., and expected great things, but instead
of compelling the League to bring its laws
into line, the Association altered its own
to correspond with those of the League.
Looking at this from a broad point of view,
it is hard on a player who has cost his club
nothing, but has signed on for a year. At the
end of that season he is free, and his old club can
put an astonishing large sum on his head. This is
hardly in accordance with English love of fair
play, and is probably one of the few blots on
the game. I am looking forward to the day when
this system shall be abolished, and the player shall
be a man, not a slave. Of course, if a club gets a
large transfer for a player, then in one way it
should have some compensation if he leaves them,
but in some cases a young fellow goes elsewhere
and they get more out of his transfer fees than
they ever paid him in wages. It must be admitted
that things at the present day are infinitely better
than they were some years ago. The player has
the right of a special appeal to a Committee of the
League, and the amount asked for players' transfers
has been greatly reduced. Still, I think that
his club should keep him until his transfer is
settled. Talking about the old Players' Union, it
reminds me that at one meeting we had, a player
stated that if a club had a horse they wanted to
part with, some one would have to find the horse
in fodder until the negotiations were finished. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
player is during that time between the devil and the
deep blue sea, and has to entirely support himself
during that period, and I have known many excellent
players give up the game for this reason.</p>

<p>Turning next to the question of the limit wage
of £4 per week for any professional, there are a
great many pros and cons in this case, and once
again I think there is a certain amount of room
for improvement. Should the abolition of the
transfer system become law, ere long the wage
limit will have to be most seriously considered.
The clubs themselves have the power to alter it at
any annual meeting of the F.A. They brought
it upon themselves to a certain extent, for at the
general meeting it is the clubs that settle such
points as these. It cannot be denied that much of
the levelling of the clubs in recent years must be
attributed greatly to this rule. Whether it has
been for the good of the game is another question,
but often a player knows that if he plays an
ordinary game he can always secure £4 per week.
He has no monetary incentive to improve himself,
and this is perhaps the reason why "star artists"
do not come to the front more frequently. Last
year the F.A. raised the fee for playing in an International
game from three guineas to ten, which, to
my mind, was a step in the right direction,
although the player should consider the honour of
playing for his country above any mercenary
reason. Again, if a professional footballer could
have such a long connection with the game as a
professional cricketer, a wage of £4 per week
would not be so bad, but as his career is a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
one, no time can be depended upon. This should
be well weighed by the administrators who look
after the interests of the players. I should like to
see the control of the game, as far as the appointment
of referees and linesmen is concerned,
left to an independent body to be appointed by the
F.A., who will give the appointments without
favour. It may be rather a tall order just at present,
but the suggestion is worthy of consideration.
Should an official who wears glasses referee in
a first-class match? is a question which is greatly
discussed throughout the land. After talking the
matter over with an old player, my opinion is that
if a player can play the game in glasses surely he
can follow the ball as a referee. An old player
who was in conversation with me the other day
was exceedingly bitter on the question, and I
should really think that if the matter was put
strongly before the F.A., sanction would be given
to an old player to follow his favourite game
in the capacity of referee. Whilst speaking
about referees, I should like to see the Association
give him power to order a man off the field
for a foul without having to report him to the
parent body. The punishment to the club by
losing him would be quite sufficient, and we may
be sure they would not deal with him very lightly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<br />
Present-Day Football.</h2>


<p>There are not wanting signs that football has not
yet finished expanding. Every season sees more
clubs in villages as well as in towns, and the
County Associations also report a numerical increase.
But whether or not there will be a sharper
dividing line between amateur and professional is
difficult to say. It may be that before long we
shall have one authority for the amateur game and
another for the professional. It must not be forgotten
that there are tens of thousands of the one
class, but only a few of the other. But the paid
player, by reason of the leisure he has, shows the
highest skill, and in that way has inspired the
unpaid with a higher ideal of play, and it is a
favourite contention of many that the best game
is that played by the professional clubs. The
junior who goes to see Aston Villa, Chelsea, Manchester
United, or Newcastle is impressed by the
play, and makes up his mind to try and put into
practice what he has seen. It is good for the boy
to go and see players of the highest skill, and if
the ordinary club member would do this occasionally
the average standard of play would be higher.
A boy who is an enthusiastic right back, and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
anxious to play in that position, can hardly do
better than go and watch Robert Crompton, the
famous right back of the Blackburn Rovers. He
is an example of what our elementary schools produce.
As a lad he took part in the game at Moss
Street Board School, an institution that had produced
a side that had carried off the trophy offered
to the schools. When at work as a plumber he
played in the League team of a Sunday school, and
when engaged one day was seen by Mr. John
Lewis, who got him to play for the Rovers. For
some couple of years he remained an amateur, but
then became a professional. He became captain
in 1899, and has several International "caps."
He uses his head, and tries to anticipate the intentions
of his opponent. He kicks with either foot
with great power, and is a clean player. He follows
the ball rather than the man. He is an excellent
example of the man who, taking to football, has
found it possible to stick to his trade as well.</p>

<p>Another player is James Sharp, who is a splendid
outside right. In him you have a reminder that
skill may make up for lack of inches. He is only
5 ft. 7 in., but he is one of the men who have
worked hard to attain their position and also to
keep it. He can dribble well, feint, pass, shoot,
and yet keep control of the ball. He came from
Hereford, where he was a member of the local
club, and after two seasons went to Everton. In
his every action you can see the man who plays for
his club. He is determined and strong, given to
making the most of an opportunity. It is difficult
for the adversary to know what he is going to do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
Here is the ideal all-round sportsman. Little
wonder he has succeeded so well on the cricket
field. He is not content to excel in one department.
Once we thought he would become a great
fast bowler, then he began to progress as a batsman,
and at the moment of writing has concluded
a great season for his adopted county, whose fortunes
have been very low. He, too, is in business,
and life for him is truly strenuous, as his play is.
We could do with more player-workers of this
modest young man's type.</p>

<p>And if you come to the front line watch V. J.
Woodward, our leading gentleman player. The
son of an architect living in a house that overlooks
the Oval, he learned his game at a school at
Clacton, and then resided at Chelmsford, where
one day a director of the 'Spurs, happening to
know that a match was being played in the County
Cup Competition, thought he would have a look,
and did so. He was struck with the skill of
Vivian J. Woodward as a centre forward, and as
the result of a chat he was got to play for Tottenham
Hotspur. This was some six years ago.
He at once made his mark, and no man was
ever so loved by professionals. No fairer player
ever stepped on to the field. Note his clean,
delightful runs, how unselfish he is; indeed, it was
freely reported that he was left out of a series of
Internationals because he showed so much consideration
for his partners. What a glorious
tribute to the sportsmanship of the man! Yes, for
clean, clever, aye, cultured forward play, watch
V. J. Woodward, who can only get away on Satur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>days
because he earns his living. He is a grand
wicketkeeper and cricket captain who has not the
time for county games. And he is a genuine
amateur&mdash;no riding third class and charging
first. He is an honourable performer, who
looks to all to play a clean game, and expects
the referee to see they do. If such amateurs are to
be driven out of the Soccer game by "money-making
limited liability companies" and their
unending squabbles, it will be a bad day for sport.
You can still see Needham, old, I suppose, as
players go. What a strategist he is. His play is
that of the man who loves the game; he can still
tackle, pass, defend, and shoot as finely as of old.
Of goalkeepers, one can see many. Ashcroft; Sutcliffe;
Lunn, of Wolverhampton; Hardy, of Liverpool;
Maskery, of Derby County, are all good.
There are many misconceptions about the game,
and most people think that the referee is compelled
to use a whistle. But if you read the laws
of the game or the directions to referees, you find
that nowhere is he instructed to use a whistle.
The word is "signal," but it might be by a
trumpet, or a motion of the hands or arms. When
the referee "signals," by whistle or otherwise, at
the commencement of the game, it means that he
is ready and the players can start as soon as they
like, but the period of play is counted from the
actual kick. The offside rule is very difficult for
the spectator; talk to them, and they will tell you
confidently that no player can be offside if he has
three of the opposition in front of him, that is,
nearer to their own goal. Yet, as Mr. William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Pickford has pointed out, a player could be offside
with eleven opponents in front of him. It is
not likely, but it could happen. If a player has
not three opponents in front of him when the ball
was last played by one of his own side, who was
behind him, he is offside, and he remains so till
someone else plays the ball, and if in the interval
the rest of the team ran back on goal he would still
be offside.</p>

<p>Again, what is an amateur? Well, conscience
will decide in the light of the rule. He must not
receive remuneration or consideration of any sort
above his necessary hotel expenses and travelling
expenses actually paid. The men who pay for
their sport are getting fewer and fewer. It is a
pity. But on these and many other points you
can obtain valuable booklets from the F.A., 104,
High Holborn, London, W.C. They publish
also a referees' chart, with the interpretation that
is officially put upon many rules. They are mines
of useful information for those who know but little
of the game.</p>

<p>It would seem as if the game is rapidly spreading
on the Continent, and every country takes up
the sport save Turkey and Russia. England is
the mentor, and the Football Association have
a great work. It may be that the love of sport will
so grow that ere many years are over we shall see
several European teams competing here year by
year. In the early stages of the development the
game will be amateur, but later on will come the
paid player. One writer says, "No money, no
first-class football." This is rubbish; it is much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
to be regretted, such a sentiment, for we can get
the highest skill from those who play for the love
of the game. The giants of the past who created
the present demand were unpaid, and the future
will still produce those who will not play for gold.</p>

<br />
A Few Famous Cup-Ties.</h2>


<p>The English Cup is probably a bigger attraction
to a footballer than any other. To a Scottish
footballer his International cap against England
is to achieve the height of his ambition, but somehow
in England, to participate in the final at the
Crystal Palace in April is the heart's desire of the
average player. There is a glamour surrounding
the English Cup Competition that nothing else can
compare with.</p>

<p>I well remember when the Scottish clubs were
entitled to enter into the arena, and such great
clubs as Queen's Park, Glasgow Rangers, Cowlairs,
Heart of Midlothian entering in the lists
against the best clubs that prevailed at the time
in England. Queen's Park, still the premier
amateur club in Scotland, also the Heart of Midlothian,
made history in this competition, but the
first-named must be given the laurels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>There are still many old players in Scotland who
maintain that in the first year, when they were
beaten by Blackburn Rovers, the result should
have gone the other way. As it was before my
day I cannot, naturally, go into the matter as thoroughly
as I should desire, but when such players
as Messrs. Smellie and Campbell have assured me
that they should have had the victory, I rather feel
inclined to believe their statement. Queen's Park,
as already stated, were for many years the greatest
club in Scotland, and they played the game for
the love of it, for when in the two finals which
were played at the Oval most of their members
had to travel overnight to play on the following
day, which speaks for itself. A great deal has
been said, as well as written, about this matter,
and it is often asked if the "Queens" deserved
to win.</p>

<p>Perhaps the finest Cup-tie that has been seen at
the Palace was the meeting of Everton and Aston
Villa in 1897. I had thought at one time to participate
in this final, but after playing three rounds
I got knocked out, and was unable to play. I
must say that my substitute at centre forward did
exceedingly well, and I could not grumble in any
way at being left out. The ordinary London man
will always remember this match, when the Villa
eventually finished winners by three goals to two.
I followed it very keenly, and in one way my sympathy
went to the losers, because there was little or
nothing to choose between them.</p>

<p>Coming to Southern clubs, probably Southampton
have been the most disappointed club that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
come into the list, especially through their great
Cup-tie with Notts Forest, at the Crystal Palace, in
the semi-final of the Cup. A great amount of
correspondence was entered into at the time, and
everybody really admitted that they were most unlucky
to be beaten at the last minute in a blinding
snowstorm. Many people will remember how this
tie was stopped in the middle of the game, and
after resuming it with only a few minutes before
the finish the result was a draw. At almost the
last moment Notts Forest broke away and scored a
goal which many people considered should never
have been allowed, simply because they did not
see it. The snowstorm was heavier than when the
referee stopped the game earlier on, but he allowed
it to go on because he expected the game
would result in a draw. Whether this is correct
or not I cannot say, but the fact remains that the
good people of Southampton still maintain that
they had not their dues on that day.</p>

<p>Something has been written of late about a goalkeeper
letting his side down in a final tie, but I
cannot believe that any player, whether goalkeeper
or forward, could or would let his side down.</p>

<p>I do not care to enter into the year when my old
club, Tottenham Hotspur, won the Cup, but one
of the biggest officials in the Football Association
came along to compliment me, and said that my
side gave the best display of football since Aston
Villa won the Cup&mdash;indeed, he implied that it was
even better than that given by the Villa, which
compliment I naturally appreciated. It was indeed
a great day at the Palace, and I do not propose to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
dwell upon the goal allowed by Mr. Kingscott to
our opponents. Our players were sure that the ball
had not crossed the line, but as we won on the replay
at Bolton everything was forgiven and forgotten.</p>

<p>Another great match in the early days was at
Manchester, between Everton and Wolverhampton
Wanderers. Everton, the previous Saturday, had
sent a reserve team to Wolverhampton. They
won quite easily. I cannot say what the score was,
but it was four or five goals to nothing. In the
final at Manchester, Everton were eventually
beaten by a long shot in the early part of the game.
There was no doubting their superior skill, but
this result simply proved that cup-tie football is
quite different from league football.</p>

<p>There are two clubs in the South that have
brought Southern football to the front: Southampton
and Tottenham Hotspur. To the latter all
due credit must be given for winning the Cup, but
the "Saints," as they are called, have done equally
as good work as the 'Spurs. They were really the
pioneers of professional football in the Southern
League, and when one considers they were in the
final in 1900, and again in 1902, when they were
beaten by Sheffield United after a drawn game, it
reflects great credit upon them. They do not
receive the credit they deserve from their own supporters,
and the severance of two of their
best local players in 1906 was a severe handicap
to the team. By the way, they were both born
and bred in the district, and caused a great sensation
in the League. Perhaps one of the biggest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
surprises in the finals of the English Cup was the
great victory of Bury over Derby County. The
former won by six goals to nothing, but this was
entirely due to Fryer being far from fit to play and
letting the first three goals go past him. If his
knee had been all right it would never have happened.</p>

<p>My old friend, Charlie Campbell, often talks of
his old Cup-tie experiences, and sometimes has referred
to the meetings of his old club, Queen's
Park, with Notts Forest and Blackburn Rovers. In
my early days Mr. Campbell was to my mind
quite a hero. He would go out of his way to
advise and encourage juniors, and much of my
success at Queen's Park and Everton was due to
the advice which he gave me in those days. Talking
about Tottenham Hotspur in the year they won
the Cup, practically the best victory was over
Bury, who were the holders of the "Little Pot"
at that time. There was more enthusiasm shown
over that match than I consider has been seen
during any other Cup-tie that I have ever
played in. The game was fought in a proper
spirit, and when Bury scored in the first few
minutes it was thought that all was over regarding
Tottenham's chances. However, we got exceedingly
well together, and won by two goals to one,
amidst the greatest enthusiasm. It outshone the
reception after the Bolton match, our victory over
Reading, and all other great games the 'Spurs
have distinguished themselves in. It is not for
me to dwell upon the great reception the 'Spurs
had on their return from Bolton. The only regret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
is that they have not won the Cup again, nor has
another Southern club had that honour. Southampton,
as well as the 'Spurs, have done much to uphold
the prestige of the South in the Cup, and it
now behoves the other clubs to gird themselves for
the fray, and demonstrate that Southern football
is quite capable of holding its own against the
North. The winning of the Cup by a Southern
club next April would be the best possible proof of
this.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="LAWS_OF_THE_GAME" id="LAWS_OF_THE_GAME"></a>LAWS OF THE GAME.</h2>


<h3>Number of Players.&mdash;Field of Play.&mdash;The Ball.</h3>

<p>1. The game should be played by eleven players on
each side. The dimensions of the field of play shall
be&mdash;maximum length, 130 yards; minimum length, 100
yards; maximum breadth, 100 yards; minimum breadth,
50 yards. The field of play shall be marked by boundary
lines. The lines at each end are the goal lines, and the
lines at the side are the touch lines. The touch lines
shall be drawn at right angles with the goal lines<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>.
A flag with a staff not less than five feet high shall be
placed at each corner. A half-way line shall be marked
out across the field of play. The centre of the field
of play shall be indicated by a suitable mark, and a
circle with ten yards' radius shall be made round it.
The goals shall be upright posts fixed on the goal lines,
equi-distant from the corner flagstaffs, eight yards
apart, with the bar across them eight feet from the
ground. The maximum width of the goal posts and
the maximum depth of the crossbar shall be five inches.
Lines shall be marked six yards from each goal post at
right angles to the goal lines for a distance of six yards,
and these shall be connected with each other by a line
parallel to the goal lines; the space within these lines
shall be the goal area. Lines shall be marked eighteen
yards from each goal post at right angles to the goal
lines for a distance of eighteen yards, and these shall
be connected with each other by a line parallel to the
goal lines; the space within these lines shall be the
penalty area. A suitable mark shall be made opposite
the centre of each goal twelve yards from the goal
line; this shall be the penalty kick mark. The circum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>ference
of the ball shall not be less than twenty-seven
inches nor more than twenty-eight. The outer casing
must be of leather, and no material shall be used in the
construction of the ball which would constitute a danger
to the players. In International matches the dimensions
of the field of play shall be&mdash;maximum length, 120
yards; minimum length, 110 yards; maximum breadth,
80 yards; minimum breadth, 70 yards; and at the commencement
of the game the weight of the ball shall be
from thirteen to fifteen ounces.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> (The touch and goal lines must not be marked by
a V-shaped rut.)</p></div>


<h3>Duration of Play.&mdash;Choice of Goals.&mdash;The Kick-off.</h3>

<p>2. The duration of the game shall be ninety minutes,
unless otherwise mutually agreed upon. The winners
of the toss shall have the option of kick-off or choice of
goals. The game shall be commenced by a place kick
from the centre of the field of play in the direction
of the opponents' goal line; the opponents shall not
approach within ten yards of the ball until it is kicked
off, nor shall any player on either side pass the centre of
the ground in the direction of his opponents' goal until
the ball is kicked off.</p>

<p>(If this law is not complied with the kick-off must be
taken over again.)</p>


<h3>Changing Ends.&mdash;The Interval.&mdash;The Re-start.</h3>

<p>3. Ends shall only be changed at half-time. The
interval at half-time shall not exceed five minutes, except
by consent of the referee. After the goal is
scored, the losing side shall kick off, and after the
change of ends at half-time, the ball shall be kicked
off by the opposite side from that which originally did
so; and always as provided in Law 2.</p>


<h3>How a Goal is Scored.&mdash;If Bar is Displaced.&mdash;If Ball
Rebounds or Goes Out of Play.</h3>

<p>4. Except as otherwise provided by these laws a goal
shall be scored when the ball has passed between the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
goal posts under the bar, not being thrown, knocked
on, nor carried by any player of the attacking side. If
from any cause during the progress of the game the bar
is displaced, the referee shall have power to award a
goal if in his opinion the ball would have passed under
the bar if it had not been displaced. The ball is in play
if it rebounds from a goal post, crossbar, or a corner
flagstaff into the field of play. The ball is in play if it
touches the referee or a linesman when in the field of
play. The ball is out of play when it has crossed the
goal line or touch line, either on the ground or in the
air.</p>

<p>(The whole of the ball must have passed over the
goal line or touch line before it is out of play.)</p>


<h3>The Throw-in.</h3>

<p>5. When the ball is in touch, a player of the opposite
side to that which played it out shall throw it in from
the point on the touch line where it left the field of
play. The player throwing the ball must stand on the
touch line facing the field of play, and shall throw the
ball in over his head with both hands in any direction,
and it shall be in play when thrown in. A goal shall
not be scored from a throw-in, and the thrower shall
not again play until the ball has been played by another
player.</p>

<p>(This law is complied with if the player has any part
of both feet on the line when he throws the ball in.)</p>


<h3>Offside.</h3>

<p>6. When the player plays the ball, or throws it in
from touch, any player of the same side who at such
moment of playing or throwing in is nearer to his
opponents' goal line is out of play, and may not touch
the ball himself, nor in any way whatever interfere
with an opponent or with the play, until the ball has
been again played, unless there are at such moment of
playing or throwing in at least three of his opponents
nearer their own goal line. A player is not out of play
in the case of a corner kick, or when the ball is kicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
off from the goal, or when it has been last played by an
opponent. A player cannot be out of play in his own
half of the ground.</p>

<p>7. When the ball is played behind the goal line by a
player of the opposite side, it shall be kicked off by any
one of the players behind whose goal line it went, within
that half of the goal area nearest the point where the
ball left the field of play; but if played behind by any
one of the side whose goal line it is, a player of the
opposite side shall kick it within one yard of the nearest
corner flagstaff<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>. In either case an opponent shall
not be allowed within six yards of the ball until it is
kicked off.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_B_2" id="Footnote_B_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_B_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> (The corner flag must not be removed when a
corner kick is taken.)</p></div>

<p>8. The goalkeeper may, within his own half of the field
of play, use his hands, but shall not carry the ball.
The goalkeeper shall not be charged except when he
is holding the ball or obstructing an opponent, or when
he has passed outside the goal area. The goalkeeper
may be changed during the game, but notice of such
change must first be given to the referee.</p>

<p>(If the goalkeeper has been changed without the
referee being notified, and the new goalkeeper shall
handle the ball within the penalty area, a penalty kick
must be awarded.)</p>

<p>9. Neither tripping, kicking, nor jumping at a player
shall be allowed. A player (the goalkeeper excepted),
shall not intentionally handle the ball under any pretence
whatever. A player shall not use his hands to
hold or push an opponent. Charging is permissible,
but it must not be violent or dangerous. A player shall
not be charged from behind unless he is obstructing an
opponent.</p>

<p>10. When a free kick has been awarded, the kicker's
opponents shall not approach within six yards of the
ball, unless they are standing on their own goal line.
The ball must at least be rolled over before it shall be
considered played, <i>i.e.</i>, it must make a complete cir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>cuit
or travel the distance of its circumference. The
kicker shall not play the ball a second time until it has
been played by another player. The kick-off (except as
provided by Law 2), corner kick, and goal kick shall be
free kicks within the meaning of the law.</p>

<p>11. A goal may be scored from a free kick which is
awarded because of any infringement of Law 9, but not
from any other free kick.</p>

<p>12. A player shall not wear any nails, except such as
have their heads driven in flush with the leather, or
metal plates, or projections, or gutta percha on his boots,
or on his shin guards. If bars or studs on the soles or
heels of the boot are used they shall not project more
than half an inch, and shall have all their fastenings
driven in flush with the leather. Bars shall be transverse
and flat, not less than half an inch in width, and shall
extend from side to side of the boot. Studs shall be
round in plan, not less than half an inch in diameter,
and in no case conical or pointed<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>. Any player discovered
infringing this law shall be prohibited from
taking further part in the match. The referee shall, if
required, examine the players' boots before the commencement
of a match.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_C_3" id="Footnote_C_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_C_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> (Wearing soft india rubber on the soles of boots
is not a violation of this law.)</p></div>

<p>13. A referee shall be appointed, whose duties shall
be to enforce the laws and decide all disputed points;
and his decision on points of fact connected with the
game shall be final. He shall also keep a record of the
game and act as timekeeper. In the event of any ungentlemanly
play on the part of the players the offender,
or offenders, shall be cautioned, and if further offence
is committed, or in case of violent conduct, without any
previous caution the referee shall have power to order
the offending player off the field of play, and shall transmit
the name or names of such player or players to his
or their National Association, who shall deal with the
matter. The referee shall have power to allow for time
wasted, to suspend the game when he thinks fit, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
terminate the game whenever by reason of darkness,
interference by spectators, or other cause he may deem
necessary. But in all cases in which a game is terminated
he shall report the same to the Association under
whose jurisdiction the game was played, who shall have
full power to deal with the matter. The referee shall
have power to award a free kick in any case in which
he thinks the conduct of a player dangerous, but not
sufficiently so as to justify him in putting in force the
greater powers vested in him. The power of the referee
extends to offences committed when the play has been
temporarily suspended and when the ball is out of play.</p>

<p>(Persistent infringement of any of the laws of the game
is ungentlemanly conduct within the meaning of this
law. All reports by referees to be made within three
days after the occurrence (Sundays not included), and
reports will be deemed to be made when received in the
ordinary course of post.)</p>

<p>14. Two linesmen shall be appointed, whose duty
(subject to the decision of the referee) shall be to decide
when the ball is out of play, and which side is entitled
to the corner kick, goal kick, or throw-in; and to assist
the referee in carrying out the game in accordance with
the laws<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>. In the event of any undue interference or
improper conduct by a linesman the referee shall have
power to order him off the field of play and appoint a
substitute, and report the circumstances to the National
Association having jurisdiction over him, who shall
deal with the matter.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_D_4" id="Footnote_D_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_D_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> (Linesmen where neutral should call the attention
of the referee to rough or ungentlemanly conduct, and
generally assist him to carry out the game in a proper
manner.)</p></div>

<p>15. In the event of a supposed infringement of the
laws the ball shall be in play until a decision has been
given.</p>

<p>16. In the event of any temporary suspension of play
from any cause, the ball not having gone into touch or
behind the goal line, the referee shall throw it down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
where it was when play was suspended, and the ball
shall be in play when it has touched the ground. If
the ball goes into touch or behind the goal line before
it is played by a player, the referee shall again throw it
down. The players on either side shall not play the
ball until it has touched the ground.</p>

<p>17. In the event of any infringement of Laws 5, 6,
8, 10, or 16, or of a player being sent off the field under
Law 13, a free kick shall be awarded to the opposite
side from the place where the infringement occurred.
In the event of any intentional infringement of Law 9
outside the penalty area or by the attacking side within
the penalty area, a free kick shall be awarded to the
opposite side from the place where the infringement
occurred. In the event of any intentional infringement
of Law 9 by the defending side within the penalty area,
the referee shall award the opponents a penalty kick<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>,
which shall be taken from the penalty kick mark under
the following conditions:&mdash;</p>

<p>All players, with the exception of the player
taking the penalty kick and the opponents' goalkeeper,
shall be outside the penalty area. The
opponents' goalkeeper shall not advance beyond his goal
line. The ball must be kicked forward. The ball shall
be in play when the kick is taken, and a goal may be
scored from a penalty kick; but the ball shall not be
again played by the kicker until it has been played by
another player. If necessary, time of play shall be extended
to admit of the penalty kick being taken. A
free kick also shall be awarded to the opposite side if
the ball is not kicked forward or is played a second
time by the player who takes the penalty kick until it
has been played by another player. The referee may
refrain from putting the provisions of this law into
effect in cases where he is satisfied that by enforcing
them he would be giving an advantage to the offending
side. If, when a penalty kick is being taken, the ball
passes between the goal posts under the bar, a goal
shall not be nullified by reason of any infringement by
the defending side.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_E_5" id="Footnote_E_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_E_5"><span class="label">[E]</span></a> (A penalty kick can be awarded irrespective of
the position of the ball at the time the infringement is
committed. In the event of the ball touching the goalkeeper
before passing between the posts when a
penalty kick is being taken at the expiry of time, a goal
is scored.)</p></div>

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
